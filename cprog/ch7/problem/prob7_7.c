/*
Array of Strings
Develop a program that stores multiple strings (for example, names of programming languages) in a 
two-dimensional character array. Use a loop to print each string on a new line, explaining the concept
of string arrays.

/*concept of string arrays:
A string array is simply a collection of strings â€” i.e an array of arrays of characters.
Syntax: char arr[rows][cols];
Each row is a string, and each column is a character in that string.

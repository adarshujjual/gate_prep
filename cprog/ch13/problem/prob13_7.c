/*
Loop Variable Scope
Develop a program that declares a variable inside a for-loop and attempts to access it outside the loop.
Document the behavior and explain why the variableâ€™s scope is limited to the loop.

/*
Note:
In C, variables declared inside a block {} are local to that block.

The for loop creates an implicit block for the loop variable (i).

Once the loop ends, the scope of i ends too, and it cannot be accessed outside.

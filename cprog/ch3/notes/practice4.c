/*Problem: Write a C program that takes a year as input from the user and determines if it is a leap year
           using if-else. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also
           divisible by 400. Print whether the year is a leap year or not. Additionally, if itâ€™s not a leap 
           year,calculate and print how many years until the next leap year (assuming the next leap year is
           in the future).*/
